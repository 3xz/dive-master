# GW2 Dive Master Checklist

## What

A browser extension that adds a checklist to the [Dive Master wiki page](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dive_Master). 

## Why

The in-game achivement section is super vague and cumbersome to access.

## Usage

Firefox: [Userscript download](https://github.com/3xz/divemaster/raw/userscript/dive_master_checklist.user.js) // Requires [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or another extension that supports userscripts. (Note: At the bottom of the Dive Location table is a box to add your API key.)

Chrome download: [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dive-master-checklist/dagecimfcegiidjbhgjdbfaankglpaap)

## Todo

I want to save bits to local storage so I can also add a 'temporary' checklist. That is, I have no idea how often the data on Anet's end refreshes so if a player does a dive and then reloads the page, will the API (and the page) immediately reflect that newly completed dive?
