# GW2 Dive Master Checklist

## What

A browser extension that adds a checklist to the [Dive Master wiki page](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dive_Master). 

## Why

The in-game achivement section is super vague and cumbersome to access.

## Where

Check the Releases section.

## Todo

I want to save bits to local storage so I can also add a 'temporary' checklist. That is, I have no idea how often the data on Anet's end refreshes so if a player does a dive and then reloads the page, will the API (and the page) immediately reflect that newly completed dive?
